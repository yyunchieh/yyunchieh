## Hi there
Welcome to my GitHub page!
I'm Jaslene (Yun-Chieh Lu) and currently working in Academia Sinica as a RA, focusing on bulding multi-agent systems to improve research workflow.

## Academic Background
B.A., Political Science, with intelligent computing credit program


## Technical Skills
- Programming: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, Matplotlib), R
- AI Tools & Platforms: LangChain, LangGraph, n8n, GitHub, MCP

## Selective Projects

### 1. Streamlined Statistical Learning Research with RAG Assistant
[GitHub](https://github.com/yyunchieh/Assistant-for-Statistical-Learning)
- Elevated reliability and efficiency in answering textbook-based questions by developing a **LangGraph-based** assistant
leveraging **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** for citation-backed responses
- Enabled rapid validation of LLM outputs by integrating **LangSmith** to monitor and evaluate hallucinations, cutting manual
lookup time **from three hours to five minutes**

### 2. Voting Behavior of Taiwan: Socioeconomic Correlates
[GitHub](https://github.com/yyunchieh/Analysis-of-Voting-Behavior-in-Taiwan)
- Enhanced prediction of Taiwan’s 2024 presidential election across 20 districts (13.9M votes, 95% coverage) by enriching
government datasets from four sources
- Delivered campaign insights by training ML models (**Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost**) and analyzing key
variables with **SHAP** and **K-means clustering**; top model reached **67%** accuracy, showing a **19%** urban–rural voting gap

## Research & Technical Interests
LLM Evaluation, AI Agent, Machine Learning
